# 📱 **News-App**

## 🚀 **Introduction**

Welcome to the **News-App**! 🌍 Stay updated with the latest news from around the world 🌎, built using **Java** and **Android Studio**. The app fetches articles from the **News API** using **Retrofit2** and follows the modern **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. Enjoy a smooth, intuitive experience with real-time news updates 📰 at your fingertips!

## 💻 **Technologies Used**

- **Java**: The main programming language for developing the app 🖥️.
- **Retrofit2**: A powerful HTTP client to fetch data from the **News API** 🌐.
- **Android Studio**: The IDE where we build and test the app 🛠️.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Clean architecture pattern for a well-organized codebase 📐.
- **News API**: Source of all the latest news articles from various publishers 📚.

## 🌟 **Key Features**

- **📰 Browse the Latest News**: Stay informed with news articles from different sources and categories 🔍.

## 🧑‍💻 **Architecture Overview**

We follow **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** for the app's architecture to ensure clear separation of concerns:

- **🧩 Model**: Manages data, including fetching news from the News API 🌐.
- **🖥️ View**: Handles user interface components (UI), such as Activities, Fragments, and XML layouts 🖱️.
- **📊 ViewModel**: Acts as the mediator between the Model and View, retrieving and preparing data for the UI. **LiveData** keeps everything in sync 🔄.

## 📦 **Modules**

The News-App is divided into key modules to keep things organized and scalable:

1. **🌐 Network Module**: Makes API calls using **Retrofit2** to fetch the latest articles 🕸️.
2. **🖥️ UI Module**: Responsible for designing the user interface, including RecyclerViews and Cards 🃏.
3. **💾 Data Module**: Handles data retrieval and caching for offline reading 🔄.
4. **📈 ViewModel Module**: Prepares data from the Model and updates the UI using **LiveData** 🔁.

## 🛠️ **Getting Started**

To start using **News-App** locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your machine with `git clone` 🖥️.
2. Open the project in **Android Studio** 🏗️.
